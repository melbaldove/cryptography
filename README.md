# My journey to learning cryptography

1. __Caesar cipher__  
Produces a cipher by shifting characters of plaintext by some key.

2. __Simple substitution__  
Substitute plaintext alphabets by using a random permutation of the alphabets as a key. This is an example of a [**Monoalphabetic cipher**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher).
